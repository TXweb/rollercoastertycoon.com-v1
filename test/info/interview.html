<BR>
Rollercoaster Tycoon is primarily a construction game, with a few managerial
and strategy elements. The primary enjoyment comes from designing and constructing
the roller coasters and other rides, then watching how guests interact with them.
It's basically a bit like a toy construction set - something which
people will want to play with, rather than play against.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>Did you do all the research yourself, or did you consult ride engineers and
coaster experts</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
I did most of the research myself, using books, magazines, and other material I
came across. I found this provided me with easily enough information and it also
meant I could minimise the number of people who knew about the game during development.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>So you must have to be a massive coaster enthusiast?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
I didn't have much of a passion for roller coasters when I started the project - I was
more a fan of the engineering, the design, and the overall 'look' of them.
In fact, I didn't even enjoy riding them. But while I was doing the research for RollerCoaster
Tycoon, I began to enjoy the whole experience more and more, and the development of the
game and my enthusiasm for roller coasters then fed off each other.

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>So how does RollerCoaster Tycoon begin?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
There is an assortment of scenarios in RollerCoaster Tycoon. In some you
start with an area of land, in others you can start with a small amusement park, or
even a large park which needs improving or has problems which need solving.
<P>
But each scenario starts with only a few types of rides available - further types of
rides, attractions and scenery become available only after spending money on research.
Most scenarios do, however, have a very simple objective to achieve, such as having
at least 1000 guests in the park by the end of the 3rd year of business, and the player
has to figure out the best way to achieve this.
<P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>It all sounds very lifelike. Do you have to grapple with real-life problems like
planning permission?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
You won't come across problems with planning permission, as such, but in some of the
more difficult scenarios the land available for purchase is very restricted.
One scenario for example has a small park that desperately needs more space to expand,
but the only area of land for sale is the other side of a road. Despite the road not
being purchasable, the player can buy "construction rights" over and under the road, allowing
the two areas of the park to be linked by bridges (or by roller coasters or other rides).
There's another scenario where the local authority won't allow any removal of trees,
or any change to the lay of the land, giving a totally different challenge, as all rides
and paths have to be carefully built through the gaps between the trees and using the
landscape without changing it.
<P>

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>Any other problems we should expect to encounter throughout the game?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
There are all the usual problems like litter, unhappy guests, over-long queues,
and vandalism. Of course rides break down if they're badly maintained or getting old.
While some types of breakdown are harmless and just cause inconvenience (the doors
getting stuck on the monorail for instance) others can be seriously catastrophic.

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>What type of coasters can you build in RollerCoaster Tycoon? And where do they come from?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
Before you can construct a new ride, it has to be 'researched'. As the manager, you
specify the level of funding your research department is allowed, whether it should
be restricted to just certain groups of rides like roller coasters, thrill rides
or even enhancements to existing rides. And then your research department goes off for
several months (or years depending on how little funding you give them) returning
eventually with an invention for a new ride.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>Can players expect to find the newer coaster technologies, such as magnetically
launched rides and pipeline coasters?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
I've based most rides in the game on successful existing prototypes - I haven't
taken things into the future or put experimental rides, but LIM-launched roller coasters
do feature later in the game.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>How much control does the player have over the coaster design?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
The construction of the roller coasters (and many other ride types) is achieved
by plugging pre-set pieces of track together, piece by piece. This makes
track construction very straightforward, and although it does limit what you can
build, the vast set of angled, sloped and special track elements means you can build
virtually any track layout.

<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>Is it possible to theme a ride, in a similar way to Nemesis at Alton Towers or Space
Mountain at Disneyland Paris?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
Theming and scenery are an important aspect of RollerCoaster Tycoon. Each ride the
player builds is given three different ratings by the game - intensity, excitement
and nausea. The intensity and nausea ratings are straightforward, based mostly on
factors such as G-force, rotations, speed etc. But the excitement rating is also affected
by nearby scenery and theming, as well as many other factors, such as tunnels, crossing
other rides or footpaths, and racing. Basic scenery like trees and gardens is available
when the game starts, but further items can be researched, like Egyptian or Toyland
theming objects. Getting the excitement rating for your rides to a maximum is a major
part of the game - it means you can charge more for the ride and your profit margins soar.
<P>
<FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-2" CLASS="7" COLOR="#3791FF"><B>Why choose an isometric viewpoint - as opposed to a 3D on-ride view, which would
allow you to experience the rides you create?</B>
</FONT>
<BR>
The look and feel of RollerCoaster Tycoon is an important aspect of the game. I chose
an isometric viewpoint display system to create a very solid, accurate and consistent
view. A 3D view simply would not have been able to cope with the level of detail I 
designed the game to handle.
